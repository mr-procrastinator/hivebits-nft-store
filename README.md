# HiveBits

HiveBits is an RWA protocol which enables individuals and companies to engage in urban beekeeping through NFTs, supporting bee conservation and ecosystem sustainability.

The project allows to tokenize beehives and mint an NFT on TON blockchain, connected to each beehive.
NFT owner can:

1) get access to bee farm and api therapy center
2) get a share in bee hive products: honey, propolis, etc...

## How it works 

NFTs are minted on TON blockchain by beehives owners and selled to community members via NFT marketplace (telegram mini-app)

To get access to the bee farm or get a shares in beehive products and owner of NFT should prove an ownership for the NFT via signing a message with his/her Telegram wallet
